# Flow-Proof

# MyContract

This repository contains a simple Cadence smart contract that defines a struct and a dictionary to store instances of that struct. It also provides a function to add new instances to the dictionary.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the smart contract on the Flow Playground, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Flow Playground](https://play.onflow.org/).
2. Paste the contents of `New Contract.cdc` into the editor.
3. Deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy" button.
4. Copy the address of the deployed contract from the output.
5. Paste the address into the `New Transaction.cdc` script.
6. Run the transaction script to interact with the deployed contract and add a new struct instance.

## Usage

1. Deploy the MyContract smart contract to the Flow Playground.
2. Update the transaction script (`New Transaction.cdc`) with the address of the deployed contract.
3. Run the transaction script to add a new struct instance to the deployed contract.

## Files

- `New Contract.cdc`: Cadence smart contract file defining the MyContract contract.
- `New Transaction.cdc`: Cadence transaction script to interact with the MyContract contract.

## Note

Ensure that you have sufficient Flow tokens available on the Flow Playground to cover transaction fees when deploying the contract and executing transactions.
